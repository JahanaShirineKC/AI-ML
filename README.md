# Salary Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This project demonstrates the use of the Random Forest Regressor for predicting salaries based on years of experience. The model is trained on a dataset with features and target values, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.

## Project Structure

- `Salary.csv`: The dataset containing `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.
- `main.py`: The script for training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
